Title: Climate-sensitive Growth and Mortality in LandR with genetic modifiers
Version: 0.0.2.0004
Authors@R: person("Ian", "Eddy", email = "ian.eddy@canada.ca", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package contains climate-sensitive growth and mortality function for LandR
    with an additional genetic modifier based on provenance. 
    It is meant to be used exlusively with research on assisted migration in 
    British Columbia, Canada. Some flexibility exists in how climate-sensitivity is derived, 
    however the most robust method is to use the SpaDES modules 'PSPclean' and 'gmcsDataPrep'.
